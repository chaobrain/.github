# Brain Dynamics Programming Ecosystem

We are building an ecosystem for bain dynamics programming (BDP), evolving from our previously experimental [BrainPy package](https://github.com/brainpy/BrainPy).

The BDP ecosystem is a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that can be used to build brain dynamics models and applications.

The BDP ecosystem is designed to be modular, so you can use as much or as little of it as you need.

The details for this ecosystem please see: https://ecosystem-for-brain-dynamics.readthedocs.io/

We welcome contributions from the community, so if you have an idea for a new tool or library, please let us know! Please email us at: <chao.brain@qq.com>.
