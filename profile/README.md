# Brain Modeling Ecosystem

We are building an ecosystem for brain modeling. 

This ecosystem is a collection of tools, libraries, and frameworks that can be used to build brain dynamics models and applications.

The ecosystem is designed to be modular, so you can use as much or as little of it as you need.

For the details of this ecosystem, please see: https://brainmodeling.readthedocs.io/

We welcome contributions from the community, so if you have an idea for a new tool or library, please let us know! Please email us at: <chao.brain@qq.com>.
